# Echo — AI-Enabled Microblogging Platform

Echo is an AI-enabled microblogging platform inspired by modern social networks like Threads and X, designed to provide a fast, secure, and scalable social experience. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), Echo focuses on clean architecture, real-world backend practices, and a Copilot-style user experience for content creation and interaction.

Echo is built as a production-oriented full-stack application, not a tutorial project, with emphasis on authentication, security, scalability, and deployment best practices.

## Key Highlights

- End-to-end full-stack architecture
- JWT-based authentication with secure cookies
- Copilot-style microblogging experience (extensible for AI features)
- Clean REST APIs with proper error handling
- Deployed on Render (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend)
- Production-ready CORS, rate-limiting, and environment handling

## Features

### Authentication & Users

- User registration and login
- JWT authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Protected routes and session handling
- Rate-limited authentication endpoints

### Microblogging

- Create and delete posts (tweets)
- Like / dislike posts
- Bookmark posts for later
- Personalized feed based on following
- Profile-based post visibility

### Social Interactions

- Follow and unfollow users
- View user profiles and activity
- Real-time UI updates via Redux state management

### AI-Ready Architecture

Designed to support Copilot-style assistance for:
- Smarter post composition
- Content suggestions
- Intelligent UX enhancements
- Clean separation of concerns to easily integrate AI services later

### UI & UX

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Minimal, modern layout inspired by real social platforms
- Optimized for desktop and mobile views

### Security & Reliability

- Secure CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Environment-based configuration (no secrets in code)
- Centralized error handling
- Health-check endpoint for monitoring backend uptime

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT (Authentication)
- bcryptjs (Password hashing)
- Helmet (Security headers)
- CORS (Restricted origins)
- Rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

### Frontend
- React
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS

### Deployment
- Backend: Render
- Frontend: Vercel

## Live Demo

**Live Application:** [https://echo-socials.vercel.app](https://echo-socials.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18 or higher
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas (or local MongoDB instance)

### Environment Variables

#### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
```

#### Frontend (`frontend/twitterclone/.env`)

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.onrender.com
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MinitJain/Echo-aTwitterClone.git
cd Echo-aTwitterClone
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --prefix backend
npm install --prefix frontend/twitterclone
```

### 3. Build the frontend

```bash
npm run build --prefix frontend/twitterclone
```

### 4. Start the backend server

```bash
npm start --prefix backend
```

### 5. Verify backend health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```
